# why herma?
Herma: A rectangular pillar bearing a bust of Hermes, once used as a boundary marker and later as decoration.

Hermes was a really fast guy 🏃 and a guider of souls 👻. Romans called him mercury -- which is the fasted planet in our solar system. Hopefully this library helps you build fast and is flexible enough for you to extend as you see fit.
